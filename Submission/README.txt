Instructions for Enabling Features in Phrasal System
----------------------------------------------------
Note we have included a number of separate feature files
that we experimented with. The target phrase size feature
is contained in TargetPhraseSizeFeaturizer.java. The 
punctuation ratio feature is contained in PunctuationRatioFeaturizer.java.
The absolute difference in source/target phrase is contained in 
PhraseDiffFeaturizer.java. To enable any combination of features, simply
uncomment the appropriate files in the myfeature.ini file (also included).
